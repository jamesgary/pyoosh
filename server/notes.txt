shorten fieldnames to 3 or 4 chars if:
  - it sounds okay
  - sames you at least 50% letters
  - examples:
    - rad: radius
    - pos: postion
    - rect: rectangle
  - nonexamples:
    - circ: circle # doesn't save you 50%

game:
  start           # => starts iterating 60 fps
  get_game_state  # => current json data
  player_input(_) # => player does something (clicks something, etc)
  pause           #
  is_paused?      #

playing_field:
  step(t = 1.0/60)          # simulate physics for `t` seconds, returns nil
  game_state                # returns a hash of game_state
  add_shape(pos, vel, type) # pos & vel are vectors, type is something like circle, star, square
                            # more params could be weight, friction, etc
